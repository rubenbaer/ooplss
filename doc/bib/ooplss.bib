	abstract = {{PolyTOIL} is a new statically-typed polymorphic object-oriented programming language which is provably type-safe. By separating the definitions of subtyping and inheritance, providing a name for the type of self, and carefully defining the type-checking rules, we have obtained a language which is very expressive while supporting modular type-checking of classes. The matching relation on types, which is related to F-bounded quantification, is used both in stating type-checking rules and expressing the bounds on type parameters for polymorphism. The design of {PolyTOIL} is based on a careful formal definition of type-checking rules and semantics. A proof of type safety is obtained with the aid of a subject reduction theorem.},

	abstract = {Nominal and structural subtyping each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Nominal subtyping allows programmers to explicitly express design intent, and, when types are associated with run time tags, enables run-time type tests and external method dispatch. On the other hand, structural subtyping is flexible and compositional, allowing unanticipated reuse. To date, nearly all object-oriented languages fully support one subtyping paradigm or the {other.In} this paper, we describe a core calculus for a language that integrates the key aspects of nominal and structural subtyping in a unified framework. We have also merged the flexibility of structural subtyping with statically typechecked external methods, a novel combination. We prove type safety for this language and illustrate its practical utility through examples that are not easily expressed in other languages. Our work provides a clean foundation for the design of future languages that enjoy the benefits of both nominal and structural subtyping.},
