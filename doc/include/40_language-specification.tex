\chapter{Language Specification}
\label{ctr:languageSpecification}
This chapter contains the language specification of \ooplss.  The first
section defines the fundamental design principles used in the further
discussion of the language. Afterwards an overview of the syntax is
given. It needs to be noted that this is just an abstract definition and
differs in some issues from the real syntax implementation which does not
contain left recursion and is specified as LL(2) grammar. This section
is followed by the largest one in this chapter, containing the language
semantics, containing informal as well as formal parts and reflecting
the development of the language and the ideas behind the concepts. A
last section deals with the primitive types.

\section{Design Principles}
\paragraph{Class Based}
Creating new objects is an essential part in object-oriented
programming. \ooplss provides classes as templates for object
creation. The programmer can specify classes of objects and create
instances of them and not directly objects. Classes are considered as
first order constructs. Furthermore a program is a set of classes. Within
classes only methods and data fields are allowed.

\paragraph{Static and Safe Type System}
To reduce the set of type specific runtime exceptions \ooplss is
statically and strongly typed. Every message received by an object will
not end up in a runtime type exception. Nonetheless runtime exceptions
can occur since the type system does not prove that every statement
is possible, e.g., when sending a division by zero message to a number
object. In this case, an appropriate exception will be thrown.

\paragraph{Nominal Type System}
\ooplss has a nominal type system for modular type checking. Once the
inheritance relations are checked, it is easy to determine whether
two types are in relation or not. Since \ooplss is translated to Java,
a similar system is used, i.e., a nominal type system is implemented.

\paragraph{No Information Hiding}
Since nominal subtyping is used, information hiding hasn't got such an impact
compared to structural subtyping since all fields are automatically
available. This helps to keep the language small.

\paragraph{No Method Overloading}
In the current state of specification \ooplss does not provide a mechanism
for method overloading. Even though this makes some class combinations impossible,
it is less confusing.

\paragraph{Single Dispatch}
With the choice of Java as target platform single method dispatch is
implemented, although multiple dispatch would make some translation work
easier and clearer. For a more detailed discussion see \Cref{ctr:discussion}

\section{Syntax}
\subsection{Abstract Syntax}

not normalised and does not completely correspond with the syntax used
in the implementation. \\

\end{listing}

\subsection{Names and Identifiers}
Names in \ooplss identify variables, methods, classes and types. The
definition of names can have different origins and depends on the current
context of consideration which is given by the scope.

\subsection{Scopes}
\ooplss uses lexical scoping to define the validity of expressions and
variables which is similar to that of Java. Generally, a global scope
exists wherein the class definitions are. Each class entails a class-scope
that contains all fields, including the definition of superclasses and
supertypes. Local scopes exist within methods and can be nested arbitrary.
Nested local scopes cannot shadow already bound variables, i.e.,
definitions like in Listing \ref{lst:illegalNesting} are not allowed.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=ooplss,caption=Variable definition in local scope.,label=lst:illegalNesting]
class A {
	var x : B;

	def m(x : C) : Void {
		var x : D; // Illegal variable definition. Shadows local parameter.
	}

	def f() : Void {
		var x : A;
		{
			var x : B; // Illegal variable definition. Shadows local variable.
		}
	}

	def g() : Void {
		{
			var x: A;
		}
		var x : B; // Legal variable definition since x : A is not
							 // valid anymore.
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Whitespace and Comments}
Whitespace characters and comments separate single tokens in \ooplss. A
whitespace can either be a blank, a tab or a newline character.

Two kinds of comments are possible. First the C-style multi-line comment which
starts with `/*' and ends with `*/'. Everything between these two delimiters
is ignored by the parser. One specialty to note is, that these kind of comments
can not be nested.
The second kind is in the \cpp-style and is a single-line comment which starts
with `//'. The character sequence between this token and the next newline
is ignored.


\section{Language Semantics}
Classes build the foundation of \ooplss with two kinds of combination
mechanisms, \emph{inheritance} and \emph{extending}. The first
one creates a subclass and the second one a subtype of a given
type. For both cases a new keyword is introduced, \emph{subclassOf}
and \emph{subtypeOf}. The difference between them is the moment of
the self-type binding. In formal treatment a class is considered as a
unordered record \cite{simons_theory_2002-1}.

\subsection{Extension as Subtyping}
'Extension` is one sort of class combination in \ooplss. With
extension, the concept of nominal subtyping is implemented which is
the same as \emph{extends} in Java. Since \ooplss knows two sorts of
combination operators, a clearly distinguishable keyword is introduced:
\emph{subtypeOf}. Subtyping can be represented as a record combination
operator where the recursive type binding is performed before the
record combination. However, the operator does not only combine records,
it also overrides old fields which are shadowed by the new record and
renames parent fields \cite{simons_theory_2003-2}.

This record extension is semantically equivalent to that of Java. This
makes a straightforward implementation possible and easy to use for
current Java programmers. Listing \ref{lst:subtypeOf} shows an example
of subtyping in \ooplss. Since this is not an important property for the
implementation, this features is abandoned in the concrete implementation.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=ooplss,caption=Subtyping in \ooplss.,label=lst:subtypeOf]
class A {
	// Defines a method with parameter of type A.
	def m(p : A) : ReturnType { %\ldots) }
}

class B subtypeOf A {
	// Overrides the parent's method m(p) where A' <: A
	def m(p : A') : ReturnType { %\ldots) }
}
\end{lstlisting}

In most of the programming languages there is a keyword \base or
\emph{super} to referencing explicitly a field in the parent class. Since
\ooplss has two derivation operators, it is not possible to give the
keyword a distinct meaning. To access a parent field, the parents type
name can be used as reference to it.

%\subsubsection{Extension Operator}
%An extension operator is a binary operator merging a superclass type operator
%in a new type operator. Informally it is used to combine to classes to a new one
%which combines a class to a record which is a subtype of the original record.
%
%
%\todo{Combination operator (No method overloading)}

\subsection{Inheritance as Subclassing}
Inheritance is the second class object combination operator in
\ooplss. It is postulated by Simons' Theory of Classification
\cite{simons_theory_2004-2}. This combination is not only a sort of class
extension with code reuse where the new class needs to follow subtyping
rules but also avoids the problem of schizophrenic self-reference since
the self-variable binding is performed after the class combination
and follows the notion of inheritance in the classical sense. \ooplss
integrates this second form of combination within the nominal subtyping
model which is used as well. This dual possibility is unseen in current
programming languages.

To represent this kind of class combination the diagrams used in
this documentary differ from classical UML representation. The
dashed lines show a subclass reference between two classes like in
\Cref{fig:subclassCombination}. The solid lines represent the same as
in UML: a subtype relation between two classes.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includedot[scale=0.8]{dot/subclassCombination}
	\caption{Graphical representation of a inheritance class combination.}
	\label{fig:subclassCombination}
\end{figure}

Semantically, a subclass is a break in the subtyping hierarchy,
i.e., inheritance combines classes without holding the subsumption
property. This enables \ooplss having a class hierarchy,
whereas in Java completely new classes would be introduced as illustrated
in \Cref{fig:inheritHierarchy}. In Figure \ref{fig:javaHierarchy} the
classes \emph{C'} and \emph{D'} are the classes \C and \D in Figure
\ref{fig:ooplssHierarchy} after the combination and how Java sees the
relation between them.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\subfloat[\ooplss hierarchy]{
		\includedot[scale=0.8]{dot/ooplssHierarchy}
		\label{fig:ooplssHierarchy}
	}
	\subfloat[Java hierarchy]{
		\includedot[scale=0.8]{dot/javaHierarchy}
		\label{fig:javaHierarchy}
	}
	\caption{Class relation hierarchy in \ooplss and Java.}
	\label{fig:inheritHierarchy}
\end{figure}

Following this semantics the translation of \ooplss-code to
other object-oriented languages can be done as stated in Listing
\ref{lst:subclassOf} and Listing \ref{lst:javaTrans}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=ooplss,caption=Subclassing in \ooplss.,label=lst:subclassOf]
class A {
	var a : A;

	def m(o : A) Void {
		m(a); // Recursive call
	}
}

class B subclassOf A {
	def m(o : A) Void {
		m(a);
		A.m(a);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

Listing \ref{lst:javaTrans} presents the code that was translated from Listing
\ref{lst:subclassOf} to Java. It demonstrates the clear cut in
the subtyping hierarchy since the whole content of class \A is modified
and copied to class \B.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,caption=Subclassing translated to Java.,label=lst:javaTrans]
public class A {
	public A a;

	public void m(A o) {
		m(a); // Recursive call
	}
}

// Subclass of A
public class B {
	public A a;

	private void A$$m(A o) {
		m(a); // Recursion back to original method
	}

	// Override A.m()
	public void m(A o) {
		m(a); // Direct recursion
		A$$m(a); // Recursion call over class A
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

%\subsubsection{Inheritance Operator}
%\todo{Combination operator}

\subsection{Introducing \mytype}
Subclassing is an other sort of class combination with a
different semantics than class extension. Considering the listings
\ref{lst:subclassOf} and \ref{lst:javaTrans} one may see something rather
strange. While class \A has a recursive object type this is not the case
for class \B. Since these two classes are completely decoupled but the
classes' type is not changed from \A to \B, the expression in Listing
\ref{lst:breakSelf} can not be typed.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=ooplss,caption=Illegal method m(o : \A) : \emph{Void} in class \B.,label=lst:breakSelf]
class A {
	def m(o : A) : A {
		return m(self); //Works fine in Java
	}
}

class B subclassOf A {
	def m(o : A) : A {
		return m(self); // Breaks in subclass!
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

This code is illegal because \self is of type \B and subclassing does
not provide subsumption, in other words, \B $\nless$: \A. To overcome this problem,
a special type variable is introduced which is called \mytype.

This type variable is available in every class but has different meanings
depending on the class under consideration. It is the type correspondence
to the \self variable. Definition \ref{def:selfType} reflects this idea.

\begin{defn}[Self Type]
	\label{def:selfType}
	\self : \X and \X <: \mytype
\end{defn}

Listing \ref{lst:fixBreakSelf} fixes the code with the assumption of
definition \ref{def:selfType}.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=ooplss,caption=Type safe code with \mytype.,label=lst:fixBreakSelf]
class A {
	def m(o : MyType) : MyType {
		return m(self); //Works well
	}
}

class B subclassOf A { three different examples were introduced where subtyping forces the programmer to write code that needs unsafe type casts and runtime checks.
	def m(o : MyType) : MyType {
		MyType A.m(self); // Works fine as well
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

The demo in Listing \ref{lst:fixBreakSelf} shows how \mytype works
in \ooplss. Semantically this works because every occurrence of \mytype
is replaced with the new type of class \B. In other words, \mytype is
replaced after the classes are combined.

Listing \ref{lst:fixBreakSelf} shows the translation into the corresponding
Java code in \ref{lst:javaTransMyTypeSubclassing}.

The recursive
method calls in method $m(o : MyType)$ makes clear that subclassing
provides a proper possibility for mutual recursion mentioned in
\Cref{sec:schizoReferences}. This behaviour is intended since this gives
programmers the possibility of full control over the recursion
and the correct program flow.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,caption=Subclassing with \mytype translated to Java.,label=lst:javaTransMyTypeSubclassing]
public class A {
	public A m(A o) {
		m(this);
	}
}

public class B {
	private B A/*\$\$*/m(B o) {
		return m(this); // Recursion back to original method
	}

	// Override A.m()
	public B m(B o) {
		return A/*\$\$*/m(this); // Recursion call over class A
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{\mytype in Subtyping}
\label{ssec:mytypeInSubtype}
The \mytype was introduced to fix typing problems occurring with
inheritance. This raises the question whether a \mytype is suitable
for extension as well. This problem is illustrated in Listing
\ref{lst:myTypeSubtyping}: it is not sure which type the parameter
$o$ should have in class \B, type \B or type \A.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=ooplss,caption=\mytype within subtyping contexts.,label=lst:myTypeSubtyping]
class A {
	def m(o : MyType) : MyType {
		return m(self);
	}
}

class B subtypeOf A {
	def m(o : MyType) : MyType {
		return A.m(self);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

Let us consider the consequences if $o : B$ in class \B. First of all this
method definition would necessarily require that \ooplss would support
method overloading which it does not. But there are other consequences which
are considerably more problematic, such as that $B.m$ would not be a subtype method of the one
provided from class \A. Knowing that $B.m$ is not a subtype of $A.m$
makes it impossible to create mutual recursion which is provided by inheritance
and only naive recursion would be possible within extension. This means
that if method $A.m$ is called there is no possibility to come back to object \B
within this recursion as long as no dynamic dispatch is available since \B can
not provide an own implementation of $m$ with $o : A$. However, even if \B would
provide two implementations of $m$, one with $o : A$ and one with $o : B$, this
would lead to a contradiction if \B is used as a superclass. For this one may
consider \Cref{fig:hierarchy} and its corresponding code in Listing
\ref{lst:mixedHierarchy}. The problem is on line \ref{lst:mixedHierarchy1}.
If this code segment would be combined in class \C, \self would now be of type
\C which is not a subtype of \A.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includedot[scale=0.8]{dot/fixedSubclassingSubtyping}
	\caption{Subclassing and subtyping hierarchy.}
	\label{fig:hierarchy}
\end{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=ooplss,caption=Mixed extension and inheritance hierarchy.,label=lst:mixedHierarchy]
class A {
	def m(o : MyType) : MyType {
		return m(self);
	}
}

class B subtypeOf A {
	def m(o : MyType) : MyType {
		return A.m(self);
	}

	def m(o : A) : MyType {
		return o.m(self); // Not typeable in class C %\label{lst:mixedHierarchy1})
	}
}

class C subclassOf B {
	def m(o : MyType) : MyType {
		return B.m(self);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

For this the self compatibility is defined as follows:

\begin{defn}[Self is compatible with MyType]
	\label{def:selfCompatibility}
	For every class \A it is true that $self : X$ and $X <: MyType$ but not that $A <: MyType$
\end{defn}

\subsubsection{Binding Moment of \mytype}
To fit the behaviour described in \Cref{ssec:mytypeInSubtype} in a
uniform model of extension and inheritance, the moment when the \mytype is
bound to a real type needs to be considered more clearly. Listing
\ref{lst:bindingInMixedHierarchy} shows a mixed class hierarchy in
\ooplss. First of all \B extends \A. Here the \mytype in method $m$ is
not rebound in the subtype class, i.e., the \mytype binding in extension
is performed as early as possible.

This presents the notion of subtyping completely. However, in \B, the \mytype
is not uniformly bound. Method $f$ has another bound of \mytype than
$m$. This works perfectly fine since $B <: A$. Going one step deeper within
the hierarchy, inheritance is performed. In class \C, every occurrence
of \mytype is now rebound to type \C. This works as well since the
\self-type is defined as in definition \ref{def:selfCompatibility}. Now,
\C is also extended in \D where method $g$ is overridden. Here again,
since in extension the binding moment is performed as early as possible,
this fits well into \ooplsss model of class combination.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=ooplss,caption=Binding of \self and \mytype in a mixed context.,label=lst:bindingInMixedHierarchy]
class A {
	def m(o : MyType) : MyType { // o : A
		return m(self);
	}
}

class B subtypeOf A {
	def m(o : MyType) : MyType { // o : A
		return A.m(self);
	}

	def f(o : MyType) : MyType { // o : B
		return o.f(self);
	}
}

class C subclassOf B { // Rebinds every occurrence of MyType in hierarchy
	def m(o : MyType) : MyType { // o : C
		return B.m(self);
	}

	def g(o : MyType) : MyType { // o : C
		return g(self);
	}
}

class D subtypeOf C {
	def g(o : MyType) : MyType { // o : C
		return g(self);
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

Although everything is now typeable, the question rises whether this code
provides mutual recursion as desired? Let's consider a method call of $m$
in \C. The method call goes correctly to its superclass method
$B.m$. Now here the next problem occurs. Since the base reference
to the supertype is explicit given by the supertype's name, the base call
is passed uniformly to the supertype class which is now a superclass as well.

\subsubsection{Resolving Extension Ambiguity}
\label{sec:resolveAmbiguity}
Let's consider the extension and inheritance hierarchy in \Cref{fig:hierarchy}
again. It is clear that \C inherits \B. But what about the extension of \A
with \B? As seen before, inheritance breaks the hierarchy and only
provides the possibility of class combination. This rises the question how the
relation between \A and \B is considered when a subclass of \B exists. If
the self type in \A would be bound before the record combination to
\C, unsafe type constructs could be possible since a
method expecting type \A would not make any sense in class \C. From this
point of view the extension mechanism has two faces: in a pure
subtyping hierarchy it is subtyping and in a subclassing hierarchy the
extension mechanism is inheritance as well.

Knowing this fact, the following type hierarchy in
\Cref{fig:fixedHierarchy} can be generated for the type \C. This makes
it impossible to use an explicit recursive self reference for classes
since they are not subclass compatible anymore, i.e., the \mytype should
be used wherever possible.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includedot[scale=0.8]{dot/subclassingSubtyping}
	\caption{Subclassing hierarchy for class \C.}

\end{figure}

%\subsubsection{Method Overloading and Mutual Recursion}
%\subsubsection{}

\subsection{Type Relations}
\ooplss knows two different type relations. On one hand subtyping, which
is well known in typed object-oriented programming languages denoted with
<: or as a straight line in diagrams. On the other hand
there is a matching relation which is used to restrict type parameters
to a given protocol and is denoted with \match or with a dashed line in
diagrams, respectively. \Cref{fig:hierarchy} shows an example of a type
hierarchy in \ooplss.
%Only one subtype relation between type \A
%and \B exists. Between the other types exists a matching relation; \E
%\match \D \match \C \match \A and \E \match \B.

From this and \Cref{sec:resolveAmbiguity} follows directly that these
relations in \Cref{fig:fixedHierarchy} are true:
\begin{align}
B <: A \\
B <\!\!\#~A \label{alg:match} \\
C <\!\!\#~A \\
C <\!\!\#~B
\end{align}

Since \ooplss uses a nominal type system and not a structural one,
matching does only apply on types within the same hierarchy as under
consideration even if other object types would match types of other
hierarchies.

%\subsubsection{Matching Properties}
%\todo{Higher-order subtyping}

\subsubsection{Matching Embeds Subtyping}
Now, after some considerations about matching, let's take a look at
proposition \ref{prop:matching}. Bruce stated that `matching is the
same as subtyping in the absence of the MyType construct.' From this
proposition and definition \ref{def:matchingAsBound} the following theorem
is formulated that subtyping is embedded into matching. That this is true,
follows directly from its definition.

\begin{prop}[Matching embeds subtyping]
	\label{prop:matchinIsSubtyping}
	if $B <: A$ implies $B \mmatch A$
\end{prop}
%
%\begin{proof}
%	For this one may recall how subtyping is to understand.\footnote{See
%	definitions \ref{def:subtypeObject} and \ref{def:methodSubtyping}}.
%
%	Let $B <: A$, $X := \mu \mytype.\{m :
%	B \times \mytype \rightarrow C \} $ and $Y := \mu X. $\todo{Formal Class combiners first needed}

%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item From definition \ref{def:subtypeObject}
%		follows directly that $Y <: X$.
%
%		\item
%	\end{enumerate}
%\end{proof}

%\todo{Give a full specification of class combination operator with mytype and base rewriting}

\subsection{Class Parametrisation}
\label{sec:classParametrisation}
So far the introduction of a \mytype and proper inheritance compared to
other languages gives the advantage of proper code reuse within the type
system and specialisation of binary methods. At a first glance all this
seems not very useful since even generics like those from Java do not fit
into this model very well. Furthermore, the matching relation is not used
by method parameters and is not yet introduced into \ooplss.  As seen
in \Cref{ctr:makingSubclassingPractical} matching is used in object
parametrisation and replaces generics, being the theoretical foundation
of Java's or \cs's generics, respectively. These generics does only
allow f-bounds with subtypes but not with subclasses which is different
in \ooplss because of the matching relation between two subclasses.

\subsubsection{Translation by Mimic Templates}
Knowing that \ooplss class parametrisation is not compatible with that
from Java since Java only knows bounds on subtypes, a different more open
solution is needed. Using matching as bound provides information whether
the code within a parametrised class is legal and can be executed on
objects which are within the bound. The type checker ensures that the
code written in \ooplss is type safe and every method call can be
performed without any runtime errors since it is guaranteed that all
used fields are properly available on the passed objects.

Against this background, the \cpp templates might be a good choice for
representing parametric classes.

\begin{quotation}
`A class generated from a class template is a perfectly ordinary
class. Thus, use of a template does not imply any runtime mechanisms
beyond what is used for an equivalent ``hand-written'' class.' -- Bjarne
Stroustrup \cite{stroustrup_c++_2000}
\end{quotation}

Even \cpp templates have different semantics and are not equivalent with
the translation presented here for \ooplss, but the idea is similar,
namely to create specially named classes similar to templates. Listing
\ref{lst:parametrisationOoplss} presents a container class that is
parametrised with a match-bound of \A. Class \B extends class \A and
class \C inherits \A.

Following the definition of matching, both derived classes are not
allowed as parameters of the class \emph{Container} with the type
parameter definition of $T$ \match \A. The use of those classes
is presented in Line \ref{line:useParametrisationOoplss} in Listing
\ref{lst:parametrisationOoplss}. All of these assignments are typeable
and sound since all of these classes provide the methods assumed
by the bound.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=ooplss,caption=Parametrisation in \ooplss.,label=lst:parametrisationOoplss]
class Container[T %\match) A] {
	def m(t1 : T, t2 : T) : T {
		t.someAction(t2);
	}
}

class A {
	def someAction(x : MyType) : MyType {
		return self;
	}
}

class B subtypeOf A {
	def someAction(x : MyType) : MyType {
		return self;
	}
}

class C subclassOf A {
	def someAction(x : MyType) : MyType {
		return self;
	}
}

class Main { %\label{line:useParametrisationOoplss})
	def run() : Void {
		var foo : Container[Foo] = new Container[Foo]();
		var bar : Container[Bar] = new Container[Bar]();
		var foobar : Container[FooBar] = new Container[FooBar]();
		foo.m(new Foo());
		bar.m(new Bar());
		foobar.m(new FooBar());
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

However, Listing \ref{lst:parametrisationJava} shows
how this code is translated to Java and how the idea of templates is
adopted. Similar to \cpp templates, which generates for all distinct
template parameters a new name mangled class, for every parametrised
class a new inner class with is created with name mangling\nomenclature{Name mangling}{Name mangling us used within compilers to generate unique names to identify entities}.
These special classes are all sharing the same generic
interface \emph{Container}. The fact that an interface is needed will be
presented in the next section. One may remark that the Java interface
of \emph{Container} has dropped the f-bound. This is necessary since
subclassing would not fulfill the extension boundary in Java.

The Java code that uses the parametrised classes defined in \ooplss is
then done straightforward by replacing the square brackets to dollar
signs as presented in Line \ref{line:useParametrisationJava} of Listing
\ref{lst:parametrisationJava}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,caption=Container class translated to Java.,label=lst:parametrisationJava]
public interface Container<T> {
	public T m(t T);

	static public class Container$Foo$ implements Container<Foo> {
		public Foo m(t Foo) {
			t.someAction();
		}
	}

	static public class Container$Bar$ implements Container<Bar> {
		public Bar m(t Bar) {
			t.someAction();
		}
	}

	static public class Container$FooBar$ implements Container<FooBar> {
		public FooBar m(t FooBar) {
			t.someAction();
		}
	}
}

public class Main { /*\label{line:useParametrisationJava}*/
	public void run() {
		Container<Foo> foo = new Container.Container$Foo$();
		Container<Bar> bar = new Container.Container$Bar$();
		Container<FooBar> foobar = new Container.Container$FooBar$();
		foo.m(new Foo());
		bar.m(new Bar());
		foobar.m(new FooBar());
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Specialising Parametrised Classes}
As seen in the previous section, parametrising classes with matching
now fits the model well. However, since parametrised classes
can be inherited as well, this will now be presented that this
is straightforward as well. For the sake of simplicity, only the
translated Java code is presented because fields that are not using
parameters are translated in the same manner as in normal classes.
Listing \ref{lst:extendingContainer} shows an extended version of the
\emph{Container} class.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,caption=Extending a container class translated to Java.,label=lst:extendingContainer]
public interface SpecialContainer<X> extends Container<X> {
	public X f(X x);
	static public class SpecialContainer$Foo$
			extends Container$Foo$
			implements SpecialContainer<Foo> {
		public Foo m(Foo x) {
			return x;
		}
	}
	static public class SpecialContainer$Bar$
			extends Container$Bar$
			implements SpecialContainer<Bar> {
		public Bar m(Bar x) {
			return x;
		}
	}
	static public class SpecialContainer$FooBar$
			extends Container$FooBar$
			implements SpecialContainer<FooBar> {
		public FooBar m(FooBar x) {
			return x;
		}
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Avoid Type Erasure}
The idea of generating new extended classes instead of a runtime generic
support or type erasure is not new even though the idea is a bit different
with the similar consequences.  Cartwright and Steele proposed
another kind of generics in Java competing with GJ\nomenclature{GJ}{The
research language for the Java generics. It is a short form of `Generic
Java'. Due to copyright law, the name is abbreviated} from Odersky and
Wadler and is presented in \cite{cartwright_compatible_1998}. Their
project is called NextGen and is based on Java 1.2. In contrast to GJ
and the current generics implementation in Java, this project provides an
extension that is not backward compatible to non generic code. However,
since no generic types are used at runtime, type parameters are not
erased like in GJ and Java 1.5.

With this, the language gains on runtime expressiveness since an
\emph{instanceof} operator can be introduced to perform checks on type
variables which Java can not, since Java has not runtime type information
after the type erasure is done. Furthermore the creation of new objects
would also be possible as long as a class provides a standard constructor.

As a drawback of creating all these classes, especially  if a language
would support a modular code generation, a more sophisticated bytecode
analysis and engineering is needed, which \ooplss does not have so far.

A further but not so relevant problem is the generated code overhead.

\subsubsection{Implicitly Parametrised Classes with \mytype}
\label{sec:implicitlyMyType}
To conclude this section about parametrisation let's consider the
\mytype construct. As seen in \Cref{ctr:theoreticalBackground}, the
\self variable can be bound to its real type by applying the unbound
type operator recursively. To grasp this notion in \ooplss, classes
can be considered as implicitly parametrised. Since both, subtyping
and subclassing, are available, the type parameter list is extended
with one additional type parameter in every subtype. Only this makes it
possible to derive binary methods in subtypes and subclasses as well. An
explicitly parametrised hypothetical use of \mytype is presented in
Listing \ref{lst:explicitMyType}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=ooplss,caption=Explicit \mytype parametrisation.,label=lst:explicitMyType]
class A[MyType <# A] {
	def m(o : MyType) MyType {
		// Self is explicitly typed in the method.
		return self;
	}
}

class B[MyType <# B, MyType$A$ <# A] subtypeOf A[MyType$A$] {
	// MyType of class A is used in class B
	def m(o : MyType$A$) : MyType$A$ { %\ldots) }
	%\ldots)
}

class C[MyType <# C] subclassOf A[MyType] {
	%\ldots)
}

class D[MyType <# D] subclassOf B[MyType, MyType] {
	%\ldots)
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Built-in Types}
\label{sec:builtinTypes}
Within \ooplss exists some built-in types. Even they are represented
as objects they have no methods and can not be derived. They are
similar in use to primitive data types and are defined as such types
to provide simple data types that can be used intuitively. Table
\ref{table:builtinOperations} presents the operators supported by
the types. For an easier treatment of the basic types, the tables
\ref{table:arithmeticOp} - \ref{table:equalityOp} shows the type
compatibilities between two different types using these operators.

To provide simple interaction between \ooplss and the user a \emph{System}
class is introduced that is shipped with every program written in
\ooplss. It has five non-static methods: \textit{print, println,
printlnInt, readln} and \textit{readfile}.
