\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{ctr:discussionConclusion}
\section{Discussion}
\label{ctr:discussion}
The discussion contains three sections. The first section takes
the examples from \Cref{ctr:theoreticalBackground} into account and
considers how they are expressed in \ooplss. It is shown how these
problems can be modelled in a better way in some situations and how the
programmer is supported in doing so. Here, it is assumed that the full
specification was implemented, whereas currently, the type parametrisation is
not implemented within the compiler. The difference of the implementation
and the specification is presented in \Cref{sec:statusQuo}.

\subsection{Solving prior Problems with \ooplss}
In \Cref{chap:subtypingVsSubclassing} three different examples were
introduced where subtyping forces the programmer to write code that
needs unsafe type casts and runtime checks.

\subsubsection{The Circle - Ellipse Problem}
This example is introduced in \Cref{sec:sharingTypes} where the type
hierarchy differs from the implementation hierarchy. The question is whether an ellipse
is a specialisation of a circle or the other way round.

To consider this example, both definitions of subtyping may be recalled;
in signature subtyping, which is supported by \ooplss, the
definition is that a subtype can only add but not remove fields. With this,
an ellipse can be a subtype of a circle, since an ellipse has two radii,
i.e., has at least one more field than a circle. In behavioural subtyping,
the subtype invariants can only be more restrictive. Here a circle is
a subtype of an ellipse since both radii of an ellipse must be equal
to define a circle.

However, the problem in signature subtyping is that the runtime behaviour
of this model is incorrect, e.g., a circle variable that references a
runtime ellipse object would return a wrong result for the height and
width properties and consequently a wrong area. There are difference
approaches to solve this problem there. One of them is to decouple types
and implementation completely. Unfortunately this leads to massively
redundant code which of course can be reduced with various however
problematic techniques like multiple inheritance and abstract base
classes. A more straightforward solution is now presented in \ooplss
in Listing \ref{lst:ellipseCircleOoplss} using subclasses. Although
subsumption is not available, the code of \emph{Circle} could be
reused and with the matching relation, new parametrised classes can be
introduced that can handle with both classes properly.

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=ooplss,caption=Circle-Ellipse problem in \ooplss.,label=lst:ellipseCircleOoplss]
class Circle {
	var width : Float;
	def setWidth(width : Float) : Void { self.width = width; }
	def area() : Float { return width * width * 3.1415; }
	def width() : Float { return width; }
}

class Ellipse subclassOf Circle {
	def area() : Float { return 3.1415 * width * height; }
	var height : Float;
	def setHeight(r : Float) : Void { self.height = r; }
	def height() : Float { return self.height; }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Cats and Dogs and Linked Lists}
The example presented in \Cref{sec:recursiveClosure} deals with the
problem of binary methods and consequently with object families.

In the first case binary methods are considered. In a subtyping
environment, binary methods arguments are not changeable within the type
hierarchy. This means that when a programmer wants to implement these
binary methods, unsafe type checks and casts are inevitable. A well
known example of this problem is the equals method as known in Java or
\cs. Before two objects can be compared for equality runtime type checking
is necessary although passing other object types would not make any sense.

The second case is strongly connected with binary methods and the
contravariant restriction for method parameters within subtyping. It
deals with the implementation of multiple object hierarchies with a
strong connection between them. There are two examples that present
this very well. First, suppose that parallel to an object hierarchy
of elements an object hierarchy of operations for the elements is
defined. For example, the \emph{visitor pattern} by Erich Gamma et
al. \cite{gamma_design_1995} is a good solution when such hierarchies
are defined in a pure subtyping environment and where subsumption is
important. However, if the operations are designed for homogeneous data
structures this has a drawback. If the element hierarchy changes, all
visitors need to be changed, which might not possible everywhere. Here
subclassing is maybe more appropriate. \Cref{fig:operationFamily} presents
this idea. With an appropriate parametrisation of the operation classes
it is possible to define appropriate operations for every object.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{emp}[classdiag](20, 20)
		Class.AnimalA("Animal")()("mate(Animal): Animal");
		Class.DogA("Dog")()("mate(Dog): Dog");
		Class.CatA("Cat")()("mate(Cat): Cat");

		DogA.ne = AnimalA.s + (-10, -35);
		CatA.nw = AnimalA.s + (10, -35);

		drawObjects(AnimalA, DogA, CatA);
		link(subclassof)(DogA.n -- AnimalA.s);
		link(subclassof)(CatA.n -- AnimalA.s);

		Class.AnimalOp("AnimalOperation[T<#Animal]")()("do(T): T");
		Class.DogOp("DogOperation[T<#Dog]")()("do(T): T");
		Class.CatOp("CatOperation[T<#Dog]")()("do(T): T");

		AnimalOp.w = AnimalA.e + (100, 0);
		DogOp.ne = AnimalOp.s + (-10, -35);
		CatOp.nw = AnimalOp.s + (10, -35);

		drawObjects(AnimalOp, DogOp, CatOp);
		link(subclassof)(DogOp.n -- AnimalOp.s);
		link(subclassof)(CatOp.n -- AnimalOp.s);
	\end{emp}
	\caption{Animal type family with operations on each concrete element.}
	\label{fig:operationFamily}
\end{figure}

This idea can easily be adopted to the second problem of SinglyLinkedNodes
and DoublyLinkedNodes which is presented in Section
\ref{subsec:matching}. Consequently, the node family specifies an element
family where an appropriate list class family does implement appropriate
algorithms for efficient list using.

\subsubsection{Schizophrenic Self References}
The last example considered in this chapter deals with schizophrenic self
references occuring in extension which are introduced in \Cref{sec:schizoReferences}.

This is the most obvious example affected by subclassing and
\mytype. In this example, the \emph{Vec2D} can easily reused to defined a
\emph{Vec3D}. For example, if a programmer wants to include some vector
operations on these vectors, the type system can now prevent the user
from adding two incompatible vectors.

\lstinputlisting

{../misc/sources/ooplssVectors/Vectors.ooplss}

\subsection{Status Quo of Implementation within Project}
\label{sec:statusQuo}

As mentioned before, not quite everything specified for the language
was actually implemented in the compiler. There are two specifications missing
in the implementation: simultaneous assignment while defining a variable
and class parametrisation (\Cref{sec:classParametrisation}). With the simultaneous
assignment following construct is meant:

\begin{lstlisting}[float=ht,language=ooplss,caption=Assignment on defining a variable.,label=lst:vardefAssign]
var foo = new Something();
\end{lstlisting}

Since we're compiling to Java, one more feature that
is not specified should actually be implemented, which is the code analysis
for return statements. The Java compiler recognises missing return statements
or even code that is unreachable. Since we don't have a check for this, the
compiler could generate erroneous Java code. Except for that, the type checker
can catch all type errors and correct Java code is created.

\section{Further Work}
\label{sec:futureWork}
In projects like this one, years of development could be used for
further improvements and new techniques. Some of these improvements are
discussed here. The section is divided into two fields. One presents some
possible language extensions and the other some implementation details
which would improve a proper use of the language.

\subsection{Language Extensions}
This section presents some possible extensions for the core language
independently of the implementation. The order presented is not weighted
in the sense of its importance. To create the language to a language
of wide use, all these extensions should be considered as important.

\subsubsection{Common features}
To make the language more practical, some features that are common
in programming languages should be implemented. They are left out
because they don't contribute to the main topic -- subclassing and subtyping --
of this thesis.
One main feature to note is arrays. Other quite common language constructs
would be for loops, switch statements, ternary operators, bitwise operators
etc.

\subsubsection{Pure Object Orientation}
For a straightforward use of numbers and strings with all their available
operators, they are implemented as primitive data types. This makes the
implementation easier since the operations do not have to be translated
to method calls. But this enforces special treatment of these primitive types
and the language is extensible since these operators are only available for primitive
types. To reach more coherence the native operators and primitive types should
be dropped for a more sophisticated language where binary and unary operators can be
implemented by arbitrary classes. This would have the advantage that it
would become a pure object oriented language that does not distinguish anymore
between two different types.

\subsubsection{Information Hiding}
Currently, \ooplss does not know any kind of access modifiers like
\emph{public}, \emph{protected} and \emph{private}. Without them no
information hiding is possible to define an object's interface
and its internal state separately. For a proper isolation of
internal states and external representation such modifiers should be
introduced.

\subsubsection{Method Overloading and Multiple Extension}
At this time, method overloading is not integrated in \ooplss. Method
overloading would be necessary for certain other concepts, for instance
for multiple inheritance. Introducing method overloading would affect
different constructs which is undesirable for this thesis project since
it is not the core problem treated here.

\subsubsection{Modularisation}
Modularisation is missing too. At the moment only very monolithic programs
are possible in which no separate compilation units are supported. For larger
programs the compilation time would increase dramatically and flexible work between
developer teams is not supported. This makes \ooplss in its current state
useless for serious programs, although the target platform is widely
used. Furthermore, supporting multiple files would be inevitable and
necessary for future developments. Even though simple modularisation would not be
very difficult, a more sophisticated form is proposed where modules are
higher-order constructs and can be parametrised \cite{dreyer_type_2003}.

However, with the introduction of proper subclasses, a simple form of
modularisation and code reuse is already provided. With this, adding
existing code to classes is very simple and safe.

\subsubsection{Interfaces and Abstract Classes}
Additionally to information hiding and modularisation, an
enhancement of the abstract software definition should be considered. In
\Cref{sec:comparisonScala} it was shown that abstract classes or
interfaces on class level would increase the expressiveness of \ooplss
in several situations. In combination with a powerful module system
the definition of module interfaces or higher-order classes as modules
would come hand in hand.

\subsubsection{Top and Bottom Types}
The language design has a similarity to that of \cpp in so far as it
does not have types as opposed to Java's \emph{Object} and \cs's \emph
{Object}. With this it is not possible to write methods that accept
arbitrary objects if no supertypes is specified and explicitly extended
by the programmer. This decision is made because two class combinations
are possible and an implicit base class would force the programmer to
use one of them at the very beginning of every class.

Anyway, one proposal to enable the possibility of passing or returning
arbitrary objects would be to introduce a special \emph{Top} type which
contains every possible type. The idea is similar to an \emph{Object}
but a top-type could be used in more cases, such as value types and reference
types. It is up to the programmer to introduce an own type
which is used as general base type.

\subsection{Further Implementation Work}
In contrast to \Cref{sec:futureWork}, this section deals with work that
would not change the language itself but would make it more useful
for daily work.

\subsubsection{Implementing the Specification}
As presented in \Cref{sec:statusQuo} the compiler does not provide the
full language that was specified. This would be the next step in the
implementation that should be done since parametrisation is not supported
yet.

\subsubsection{JDK Integration}
Considering the fact that \ooplss is not permanently defined on the current
target platform of the JDK, it would nevertheless be interesting to
improve the integration into the target platform. With this, a widely
known and enormous framework would automatically get available to
\ooplss programmers. The problem of this extension would be how to integrate
both derivation possibilities since Java is lacking one of them. However,
this might come simultanously with the direct translation to JDK
Bytecode, which is more flexible than the Java language itself.

\subsubsection{Subclassing with Dynamic Invokes}
The translation from \ooplss to Java is now not very straightforward since
explicit class combinations are necessary. However, in JDK 7 which will
be released in summer 2011 the JDK will get some major changes. One
of them is the introduction of the \emph{dynamicinvoke} command on
Bytecode level. This would support dynamically typed language on the
platform where the most suitable method would be called depending on the
runtime type of the parameter types. Since \ooplss has its own type
checker it would be safe to use dynamic code. With a dynamic method
lookup, the subclassing relation would be much more simple.

\subsubsection{Type Inference}
In many cases the types of a method or variable can be predicted
by the type system with a type inference algorithm. This helps
the programmer to write less code and provide more compact and readable
programs. Without changing \ooplsss semantic, such type inference
could be implemented as a next further step.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{ctr:conclusion}
There are real problems in object-oriented languages with binary methods
and code reuse if only subtyping extensions are possible within an object
hierarchy. But just dropping subtyping and using the matching relation
does not seems to be an adequate solution to solve these problems in
nominal type systems. In contrast, it could be shown that subclassing
combined with subtyping, as well as type parametrisation with matching,
can express these fundamental problems, which is not possible or
cumbersome in other languages. An other solution that can be considered
is to introduce explicit fixpoints for object types which would enable
an explicit \mytype introduction in combination with type parametrisation.

Although not every feature of the specified language was implemented,
all targets aims of the project proposal in \Cref{ctr:projectProposal}
can be considered as achieved. It has to be mentioned that some targets
were adopted during the project. As presented in \Cref{subsec:matching}
matching can not be applied usefully outside of type parametrisation
since it is too weak to use it within method parameters or variable
declarations.  Therefore matching is only specified for type
parametrisation and not thus implemented.
