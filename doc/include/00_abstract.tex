\subsection*{Abstract}
Subtyping is one of the best known type relation in object-oriented
programming languages and is an important aspect of these languages
to support sound type polymorphism. To support type polymorphism
subtyping has to restrict the subtype declaration to allow only safe type
substitutions. This prohibits to specialise binary method declarations in
subtypes. In many popular object-oriented programming languages the type
hierarchy is implicitly the same as the implementation hierarchy. This
contradicts the notion of inheritance as code reuse and subtyping as type
substitution. To solve this problem type parametrisation got introduced in
different languages which is also known as generics. But these does not
tackle recursive types used for binary methods. To solve this problem
the concept of subclassing with a special type variable \mytype got
introduced which is an implicit type parameter. But languages supporting
the \mytype variable does not allow the programmer to choose the correct
binding of the variable that fits most to the problem under consideration.

Specialising binary methods without bypassing the type system with
unsafe constructs like casts is often not possible since subtyping is
too restrictive even though it is not required for every problem.

This thesis project presents a solution that allows the programmer to
choose the accurate model that fits the problem. This is presented with
the prototypical programming languages \ooplss. To test the assumptions an
implementation of some of the features were created within this project.

It could be shown that subclassing and subtyping is not a contrary model
that can fit in one language. It avoids complex structures for typing
binary methods and includes the possibility of safe software composition
with less restrictions than subtyping.
