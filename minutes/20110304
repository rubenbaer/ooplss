Discussed Issues from last time:
* Deliverables
	- 3 Documents, one for the secretariat, one for the expert and one for the 
	  advisor
	- Should be a single document
	- Includes the CD with all the project data on it

* Documentation 
	- Should include some project managment (gantt diagramm), maybe a little
	  journal
	- The intro and conclusion are very important
	- Abstract could be englisch *and* german
	- It will be important to give good examples of subtyping and subclassing
	  to distinguish those two concepts
	- Documentation will also contain a part "Design documentation"

* Expert meeting
	- Some time during the semester there will be a meeting with the expert to 
	  show him what we're doing
	
* Implementation
	- It is up to us which languages we use to implement the different parts of
	  the project, including the target language to compile to. It could also
	  be possible to mix those languages


Todo for next meeting
* Outline of the documentation 
* Schedule, as good as possible since this is not a usual development project
* Decision, which kind of syntax style our language will have

Issues for next meeting
* Virtual Methods
* Multiple inheritance yes or no / interfaces?
