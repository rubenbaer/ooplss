Discussed Issues from last time:
* Project Schedule
  - We should use more time for the formal definition of our language
  - The same with the type checking algorithms. This task should not be underestimated

* Documentation 
  - We use a iterative development model without concrete iterations.
    

* Expert meeting
  - Meeting before easter break.
  - Duration will be from 30 minutes up to one hour
  - Short presentation what we are doing
  - It's not a defense
  - Send the current document in front of the meeting
	
* Content
  - Use many examples in different languages (Especially in the theoretical background chapter)
    - Java, C#, Scala, C++, Haskell...

Todo for next meeting
* Schedule, as good as possible since this is not a usual development project
* Decision, which kind of syntax style our language will have

Next meeting:
