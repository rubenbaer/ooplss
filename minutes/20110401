We discussed the meeting with Mr. Spichiger one day before. It was very
good and he is very interested in the subject.  We also discussed that
a more iterative project management methodology should be used but we
don't want to follow strictly the gantt diagram.

Also some dates for the next meeting and the defence of the thesis
were agreed. So we fixed it for Wednesday 28th June 2011.

Next meeting:
