Documentation Feedback:
* See separate sheet
* Vec2d/Vec3d cite to simons
* Explain the examples more detailed
* Explain Listing 8.2
* Describe subtyping relation formally. What is possible and what not. Which
  notation will be used?

Problem:
* We discussed the lookahead option in antlr3. Backtracking is only necessary if
  the grammar ambiguous.
* Lookahead of 2 is still okay. Maybe it can be set local.
* Had some problems with antlr3 and gunit. Now we are using an experimental
  version.

Meeting with Mr. Spichiger:
* Is dated for the 31.03.2011
* Mr. Biberstein can not be there. He has meetings but will call him afterwards.

ToDo: 
* Give an abstract syntax for the documentation.
* Reorganise the document so that we can finish the project!!!

Next meeting:
 Date:  01.04.2011 11:00
