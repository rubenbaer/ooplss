Place:  Hallerstrasse 8, Bern

Discussed Issues from last time:
* New language specification
  - We showed that we changed the structure of this part
	- It is less formal but more iterative and constructive which presents the ideas
		we had.
	- We should not miss formal points with this. We moved some stuff in the appendix
* Implementation part
  - We have to show that the used algorithm is decidable. Proof or good evindence
* Project schedule
  - The project is not as far as espected but not bad in time.
	
* Theoretical Background
  - Give a good reference on recursive problems in typing
	- Show where the problems are. 

Next meeting:
