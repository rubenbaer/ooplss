We could not perform all the tasks we wanted to do until this friday.
We detected a problem by combining subclassing and subtyping
simultanously. This maybe not typeable in both systems.

Documentation Feedback:
* Programmers want the functionality. But why? We will add this in the first
  chapter with the theoretical background.
* Explain Subtyping similarly to Subclassing
  - Give the definition of Liskov Substitution principle.
  - What is co/contra/invariance

Decisions:
* We will use antlr3 since it is more complete then javacc

Discussed our Problem with Subclassing / Subtyping
* We should not waste too much time with this problem.
* Make more inputs in the documentation since this has to represent our
  progress in the thesis. Reading is good but documentation is essential.
* We may will not solve this problem. Maybe we just drop the simultanously
* Problem is that a multi-method dispatch can be difficult to understand

Next meeting:
